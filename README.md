# ChatGPT Chrome Extension but now in firefoxðŸ¤– âœ¨

A Chrome extension that adds [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) to every text box on the internet! Use it to write tweets, revise emails, fix coding bugs, or whatever else you need, all without leaving the site you're on. Includes a plugin system for greater control over ChatGPT behavior and ability to interact with 3rd party APIs.

## Install
First clone/download this repo on your local machine

Then navigate to the folder, install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Copy `.env-example` into a new file named `.env` and add your ChatGPT email and password.
Note: If you are using google login, make sure to go into server.js and add `isGoogleLogin: true` as a third line inside of the gptApi function (Don't forget the comma)

#### Run the server

First navigate to the directory of this repo on your machine


Then run the server so the extension can communicate with ChatGPT.
```bash
node server.js
```

This will automate interaction with ChatGPT through a headless Chrome browser, thanks to the [chatgpt-api](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api) library. You will see the browser pop up after running your server. It should automatically log you in, but you may need to manually solve a captcha to complete the process.

#### Add the extension NOTE: Currently due to firefox permissions and security, you have two options:
1. Use normal firefox and drag in the xpi file every time you launch firefox new again
2. Use Firefox Developer to install permanently

###### Installation option 1:

1. Go to about:addons in your Firefox browser
4. Drag in your xpi file in `chatgpt-firefox-extension/extension/chatgpt-extension-firefox.xpi` 

You'll now see "Ask ChatGPT" if you right click in any text input or content editable area.

##### Installation option 2 instructions (coming soon)

## Troubleshooting

If ChatGPT is taking a very long time to respond or not responding at all then it could mean that their servers are currently overloaded. You can confirm this by going to [chat.openai.com/chat](https://chat.openai.com/chat) and seeing whether their website works directly.

Mac: If you get an error about port 3000 when you try running server.js, try killing whatever is on port 3000. Check it with `sudo lsof -i :3000` and kill it with `kill -3 <insert whatever the PID value is here>` Make sure nothing important is on that port first though.
